        <p>You don't know me<br>
            Cause I'm from a different age<br>
            And you can't see me<br>
            Cause I live in a different age<br>
            And you could hurt me<br>
            But you wouldn't know what to say<br>
            But you should believe me<br>
            Our dreams are all the same<br>
            Like a life without love<br>
            God that's just insane<br>
            But a<br>
            love without life<br>
            That shit happens every day<br>
            And I wish I could change<br>
            But I'll probably just stay the same<br>
            And I wish you could sing along<br>
            But this song is a joke<br>
            And the melody I wrote wrong<br>
            Oh you can't hear me<br>
            Cause I sing to a different age<br>
            And you should fear me<br>
            Cause I believe in a different age<br>
            But I live in a city<br>
            That lives in a different age<br>
            Oh I live in a city<br>
            That lives<br>
            in a different age<br>
            Where all the punks are writing memoirs<br>
            And I'm still singing songs<br>
            Oh all the punks ar<br>
            e writing memoirs<br>
            And I'm still singing songs<br>
            They say theirs nothing left for you hear kid<br>
            Why don't you just go home<br>
            They say this city is useless<br>
            We've already done it all<br>
            Oh all the punks are writing memoirs<br>
            And I'm still singing songs<br>
            And I wish you could sing along<br>
            But this song is a joke and the melody I wrote<br>
            wrong<br></p>
