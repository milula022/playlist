        <p>I've waited a hundred years<br>
            But I'd wait a million more for you<br></p>

        <p>Nothing prepared me for<br>
            What the privilege of being yours would do<br></p>

        <p>If I had only felt the warmth within your touch<br>
            If I had only seen how you smile when you blush<br>
            Or how you curl your lip when you concentrate enough<br>
            I would have known what I was living for all along<br></p>

        <p> What I've been living for<br></p>

        <p>Your love is my turning page<br>
            Where only the sweetest words remain<br></p>

        <p>Every kiss is a cursive line<br>
            Every touch is a redefining phrase<br></p>

        <p> I surrender who I've been for who you are<br>
            For nothing makes me stronger than your fragile heart<br>
            If I had only felt how it feels to be yours<br>
            Well, I would have known what I've been living for all along<br></p>

        <p>What I've been living for<br></p>

        <p> Though we're tethered to the story we must tell<br>
            When I saw you, well I knew we'd tell it well<br>
            With a whisper, we will tame the vicious seas<br>
            Like a feather, bringing kingdoms to their knees<br></p>
