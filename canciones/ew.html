        <p> When it's lovely, I believe in anything<br>
            What does love mean when the end is rolling in? (Ooh)<br>
            Let it go, let it stay<br>
            Can we love one another?<br>
            Cold, is it safe to be warm in the summer?<br>
            Who knows? (Who knows?)<br></p>

        <p>I said, "Who knows?"<br>
            Ooh, teach me to love just to let me go<br>
            I can't believe that I'm not enough<br>
            Not enough<br>
            And so long, no one will be here to save you<br>
            And no one will be here to let you know<br>
            Let you know<br>
            This is your world (this is your world)<br>
            This is your world (this is your world)<br></p>

        <p>Quietly still<br>
            In a lie<br>
            Oh, goodnight<br>
            I don't mind<br></p>

        <p>Ooh, teach me to love just to let me go<br>
            I can't believe that I'm not enough<br>
            Not enough<br>
            And so long, no one will be here to save you<br>
            And no one will be here to let you know (let you know)<br></p>
