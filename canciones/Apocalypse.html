        <p>You leapt from crumbling bridges<br>
            Watching cityscapes turn to dust<br>
            Filming helicopters crashing<br>
            In the ocean from way above<br></p>

        <p>Got the music in you, baby<br>
            Tell me why<br>
            Got the music in you, baby<br>
            Tell me why<br>
            You've been locked in here forever<br>
            And you just can't say goodbye<br></p>

        <p>Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers<br>
            Wrapped in your arms<br>
            You've been hiding them in hollowed out pianos<br>
            Left in the dark<br></p>

        <p>Got the music in you, baby<br>
            Tell me why<br>
            Got the music in you, baby<br>
            Tell me why<br>
            You've been locked in here forever<br>
            And you just can't say goodbye<br></p>

        <p>Your lips, my lips<br>
            Apocalypse<br></p>

        <p>Your lips, my lips<br>
            Apocalypse<br></p>

        <p>Go and sneak us through the rivers<br>
            Flood is rising up on your knees<br>
            Oh, please<br>
            Come out and haunt me<br>
            I know you want me<br>
            Come out and haunt me<br></p>

        <p>Sharing all your secrets with each other<br>
            Since you were kids<br>
            Sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you<br>
            Clutched in your fist<br></p>

        <p>Got the music in you, baby<br>
            Tell me why<br>
            Got the music in you, baby<br>
            Tell me why<br>
            You've been locked in here forever<br>
            And you just can't say goodbye<br></p>

        <p>You've been locked in here forever<br>
            And you just can't say goodbye<br></p>

        <p>Ooh, oh<br>
            When you're all alone<br>
            I'ill reach for you<br>
            When you're feelin' low<br>
            I'll be there too<br></p>
