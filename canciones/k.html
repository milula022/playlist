        <p>I remember when I first noticed that you liked me back<br>
            We were sitting down in a restaurant waiting for the check<br>
            We had made love earlier that day with no strings attached<br>
            But I could tell that something had changed how you looked at me then<br></p>

        <p>Kristen, come right back<br>
            I've been waiting for you<br>
            To slip back in bed<br>
            When you light the candle<br></p>

        <p>And on the Lower East Side, you're dancing with me now<br>
            And I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall<br>
            Think I like you best when you're dressed in black from head to toe<br>
            Think I like you best when you're just with me<br>
            And no one else<br></p>

        <p>Kristen, come right back<br>
            I've been waiting for you<br>
            To slip back in bed<br>
            When you light the candle<br></p>

        <p>And I'm kissing you lying in my room<br>
            Holding you until you fall asleep<br>
            And it's just as good as I knew it would be<br>
            Stay with me, I don't want you to leave<br></p>

        <p>Kristen, come right back
            I've been waiting for you
            To slip back in bed
            When you light the candle</p>
