        <p>Lately<br>
            I can't help but think that our roads might take us down different phases<br>
            Don't wanna complicate the rhythm that we got but I'm speechless<br>
            When everything's so pure, can it be aimless?<br>
            Painless?<br></p>

        <p>If you ever go<br>
            All the songs that we like<br>
            Will sound like bittersweet lullabies<br></p>

        <p>Lost in the blue<br>
            They don't love me like you do<br>
            Those chills that I knew<br>
            They were nothing without you<br>
            And everyone else<br>
            They don't matter now<br>
            You're the one I can't lose<br>
            No one loves me like you do<br></p>

        <p>Since I met you<br>
            All the gloomy days just seem to shine a little more brightly<br>
            Consider what we've got 'cause I can never take you for granted<br>
            Is there another us on this whole planet?<br>
            Planet?<br></p>

        <p>If you ever go<br>
            All the songs that we like<br>
            Will sound like bittersweet lullabies<br></p>

        <p>Lost in the blue<br>
            They don't love me like you do<br>
            Those chills that I knew<br>
            They were nothing without you<br>
            And everyone else<br>
            They don't matter now<br>
            You're the one I can't lose<br>
            No one loves me like you do<br>
            No one loves me like you do<br></p>

        <p>I don't wanna seem foolish<br>
            When I'm jumping into this<br>
            You're all that I see<br></p>

        <p>Lost in the blue<br>
            They don't love me like you do<br>
            Those chills that I knew<br>
            They were nothing without you<br>
            And everyone else<br>
            They don't matter now<br>
            You're the one I can't lose<br>
            No one loves me like you do<br>
            No one loves me like you do<br></p>
