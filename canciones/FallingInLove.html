        <p>When I hold you close to me<br>
            I could always see a house by the ocean<br>
            Last night I could hear the waves<br>
            As I heard you say, "All that I want is to be yours"<br></p>

        <p>Falling in love<br>
            Falling in love<br>
            Deeper than I've felt it before with you, baby<br>
            I feel I'm falling in love with all my heart<br></p>

        <p>Back when you were far away<br>
            We would go on dates to watch the same movie<br>
            And you were imagining sitting next to me<br>
            Holding my hand for the whole thing<br></p>

        <p>Falling in love<br>
            Falling in love<br>
            Deeper than I've felt it before with you, baby<br>
            I feel I'm falling in love with all my heart<br></p>

        <p>Falling in love<br>
            Falling in love<br>
            Deeper than I've felt it before with you, baby<br>
            I feel I'm falling in love with all my heart<br></p>
