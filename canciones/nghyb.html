    <main>
        <p>Whispered something in your ear<br>
            It was a perverted thing to say<br>
            But I said it anyway<br>
            Made you smile and look away<br></p>

        <p>Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby<br>
            As long as you're with me, you'll be just fine<br>
            Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby<br>
            Nothing's gonna take you from my side<br></p>

        <p>When we dance in my living room<br>
            To that silly '90s R&B<br>
            When we have a drink or three<br>
            Always ends in a hazy shower scene<br></p>

        <p>Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby<br>
            As long as you're with me, you'll be just fine<br>
            Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby<br>
            Nothing's gonna take you from my side<br></p>

        <p>And we laugh into the microphone and sing<br>
            With our sunglasses on, to our favorite songs<br></p>

        <p>And we're laughing in the microphone and singing<br>
            With our sunglasses on, to our favorite songs<br></p>

        <p>Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
            Nothing's gonna take you from my side<br></p>
