Apocalypse
Canción de Cigarettes After Sex
You leapt from crumbling bridges
Watching cityscapes turn to dust
Filming helicopters crashing
In the ocean from way above
Got the music in you, baby
Tell me why
Got the music in you, baby
Tell me why
You've been locked in here forever
And you just can't say goodbye
Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers
Wrapped in your arms
You've been hiding them in hollowed out pianos
Left in the dark
Got the music in you, baby
Tell me why
Got the music in you, baby
Tell me why
You've been locked in here forever
And you just can't say goodbye
Your lips, my lips
Apocalypse
Your lips, my lips
Apocalypse
Go and sneak us through the rivers
Flood is rising up on your knees
Oh, please
Come out and haunt me
I know you want me
Come out and haunt me
Sharing all your secrets with each other
Since you were kids
Sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you
Clutched in your fist
Got the music in you, baby
Tell me why
Got the music in you, baby
Tell me why
You've been locked in here forever
And you just can't say goodbye
You've been locked in here forever
And you just can't say goodbye
Ooh, oh
When you're all alone
I'ill reach for you
When you're feelin' low
I'll be there too

Ew
Canción de Joji
When it's lovely, I believe in anything
What does love mean when the end is rolling in? (Ooh)
Let it go, let it stay
Can we love one another?
Cold, is it safe to be warm in the summer?
Who knows? (Who knows?)
I said, "Who knows?"
Ooh, teach me to love just to let me go
I can't believe that I'm not enough
Not enough
And so long, no one will be here to save you
And no one will be here to let you know
Let you know
This is your world (this is your world)
This is your world (this is your world)
Quietly still
In a lie
Oh, goodnight
I don't mind
Ooh, teach me to love just to let me go
I can't believe that I'm not enough
Not enough
And so long, no one will be here to save you
And no one will be here to let you know (let you know)

Turning Page
Canción de Sleeping at Last
I've waited a hundred years
But I'd wait a million more for you
Nothing prepared me for
What the privilege of being yours would do
If I had only felt the warmth within your touch
If I had only seen how you smile when you blush
Or how you curl your lip when you concentrate enough
I would have known what I was living for all along
What I've been living for
Your love is my turning page
Where only the sweetest words remain
Every kiss is a cursive line
Every touch is a redefining phrase
I surrender who I've been for who you are
For nothing makes me stronger than your fragile heart
If I had only felt how it feels to be yours
Well, I would have known what I've been living for all along
What I've been living for
Though we're tethered to the story we must tell
When I saw you, well I knew we'd tell it well
With a whisper, we will tame the vicious seas
Like a feather, bringing kingdoms to their knees

Nothing's Gonna Hurt You Baby
Canción de Cigarettes After Sex
Whispered something in your ear
It was a perverted thing to say
But I said it anyway
Made you smile and look away
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
As long as you're with me, you'll be just fine
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
Nothing's gonna take you from my side
When we dance in my living room
To that silly '90s R&B
When we have a drink or three
Always ends in a hazy shower scene
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
As long as you're with me, you'll be just fine
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
Nothing's gonna take you from my side
And we laugh into the microphone and sing
With our sunglasses on, to our favorite songs
And we're laughing in the microphone and singing
With our sunglasses on, to our favorite songs
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
Nothing's gonna take you from my side

Like You Do
Canción de Joji
Lately
I can't help but think that our roads might take us down different phases
Don't wanna complicate the rhythm that we got but I'm speechless
When everything's so pure, can it be aimless?
Painless?
If you ever go
All the songs that we like
Will sound like bittersweet lullabies
Lost in the blue
They don't love me like you do
Those chills that I knew
They were nothing without you
And everyone else
They don't matter now
You're the one I can't lose
No one loves me like you do
Since I met you
All the gloomy days just seem to shine a little more brightly
Consider what we've got 'cause I can never take you for granted
Is there another us on this whole planet?
Planet?
If you ever go
All the songs that we like
Will sound like bittersweet lullabies
Lost in the blue
They don't love me like you do
Those chills that I knew
They were nothing without you
And everyone else
They don't matter now
You're the one I can't lose
No one loves me like you do
No one loves me like you do
I don't wanna seem foolish
When I'm jumping into this
You're all that I see
Lost in the blue
They don't love me like you do
Those chills that I knew
They were nothing without you
And everyone else
They don't matter now
You're the one I can't lose
No one loves me like you do
No one loves me like you do

Nothing Lasts
Canción de Bedroom
I pray to God
To stop these thoughts
It works for me
Can't you see?
Now I know that I'm better
I'm writing this letter
To my past self
Sitting on the shelf
Nothing lasts
It's for the past
I won't stay here
I won't stay there
'Cause now I'm happy
For you have changed me
I am so thankful
No longer painful

Falling In Love
Canción de Cigarettes After Sex
When I hold you close to me
I could always see a house by the ocean
Last night I could hear the waves
As I heard you say, "All that I want is to be yours"
Falling in love
Falling in love
Deeper than I've felt it before with you, baby
I feel I'm falling in love with all my heart
Back when you were far away
We would go on dates to watch the same movie
And you were imagining sitting next to me
Holding my hand for the whole thing
Falling in love
Falling in love
Deeper than I've felt it before with you, baby
I feel I'm falling in love with all my heart
Falling in love
Falling in love
Deeper than I've felt it before with you, baby
I feel I'm falling in love with all my heart

A Different Age
Canción de Nick Rattigan
You don't know me
Cause I'm from a different age
And you can't see me
Cause I live in a different age
And you could hurt me
But you wouldn't know what to say
But you should believe me
Our dreams are all the same
Like a life without love
God that's just insane
But a
love without life
That shit happens every day
And I wish I could change
But I'll probably just stay the same
And I wish you could sing along
But this song is a joke
And the melody I wrote wrong
Oh you can't hear me
Cause I sing to a different age
And you should fear me
Cause I believe in a different age
But I live in a city
That lives in a different age
Oh I live in a city
That lives
in a different age
Where all the punks are writing memoirs
And I'm still singing songs
Oh all the punks ar
e writing memoirs
And I'm still singing songs
They say theirs nothing left for you hear kid
Why don't you just go home
They say this city is useless
We've already done it all
Oh all the punks are writing memoirs
And I'm still singing songs
And I wish you could sing along
But this song is a joke and the melody I wrote
wrong

Sparks
Canción de Coldplay
Did I drive you away?
I know what you'll say
You say, "Oh, sing one we know"
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
Yeah, that's what I'll do
I say, "Oh"
I say, "Oh"
My heart is yours
It's you that I hold on to
Yeah, that's what I do
And I know, I was wrong
But I won't let you down
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I will, yes, I will
I said, "Oh"
I cry, "Oh"
Yeah, I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
Sing it out

K.
Canción de Cigarettes After Sex
I remember when I first noticed that you liked me back
We were sitting down in a restaurant waiting for the check
We had made love earlier that day with no strings attached
But I could tell that something had changed how you looked at me then
Kristen, come right back
I've been waiting for you
To slip back in bed
When you light the candle
And on the Lower East Side, you're dancing with me now
And I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall
Think I like you best when you're dressed in black from head to toe
Think I like you best when you're just with me
And no one else
Kristen, come right back
I've been waiting for you
To slip back in bed
When you light the candle
And I'm kissing you lying in my room
Holding you until you fall asleep
And it's just as good as I knew it would be
Stay with me, I don't want you to leave
Kristen, come right back
I've been waiting for you
To slip back in bed
When you light the candle
